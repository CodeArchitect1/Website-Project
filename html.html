        <h3 id="Our-Mission"> Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our before- and after-care programs go well beyond homework help. We support children in becoming the kindest, most capable, and most resilient version of themselves. That means giving each child the space, encouragement, and materials they need to follow their passions—whether they want to start a drama club, build a volcano, or create a comic book. No matter where their talents take them, we create positive communities of friends with games, STEM projects, creative arts, and plenty of playtime to keep kids happy, bright, and healthy.</p>

    <h1>Our Curriculum</h1>
    <p>Childtime’s educational philosophy is based on the Reggio Emilia approach. The heart of Reggio Emilia is the belief that children are filled with natural curiosity and bursting creativity. These attributes form the basis for learning journeys that are accomplished in a warm and collaborative environment and strong relationships with teachers and peers.</p>
    <p>A Reggio-inspired curriculum is based on children’s questions and emerging skills. This is the Cycle of Inquiry.</p>
    <li>Materials and active experiences that children need to become critical thinkers and problem-solvers</li>
    <li>A secure, caring and enriched environment that promotes learning and the development of the whole child</li>
    <li>Opportunities for self-expression and self-directed learning</li>

        <h1>Health Safety and Security</h1>
        <h2>CHAMPIONS IS A SAFE, HEALTHY PLACE FOR YOUR CHILD TO THRIVE.</h2>
        <p>Education and development are important, but we know that the safety, security, and health of your child is your top priority—and it’s ours, too. That’s why protection and preparedness are critical considerations in everything we do.</p>
        <p>You can breathe easy knowing that every day your child is welcomed into a secure, nurturing, and inclusive environment where they can truly shine!</p>
        <h2>A WELL-ROUNDED PROGRAM (WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE “WELL”)</h2>
        <p>Our teachers and staff undergo extensive training on health and safety practices, including pandemic-response protocols, so you can rest assured your child is in good hands. We work closely with our expert medical partners, including Pediatric Disaster Preparedness Doctors, and we follow CDC guidelines on evolving safety protocols.</p>
        <p>From first aid training for emergency situations to sanitation and maintaining a clean and healthy environment, we set our programs up to be happy and healthy places where kids can thrive. While scraped knees are a part of growing up, you can have confidence that your child is cared for in a secure, nurturing environment every day.</p>

            <li>Step 1 when you arrive at Champions: a wellness screening! We'll ask your child a few questions to make sure they aren't experiencing any signs of illness before jumping into the fun. We'll continue to monitor them over the course of the day.</li>
            <li>If your child doesn't feel well or starts to show symptoms while in our care, we will notify you right away and take appropriate measures.</li>
